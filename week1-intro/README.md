# Week 1 â€” Intro to Networking

## Objective
Understand the OSI model and perform basic TCP/IP diagnostics (ping, traceroute, ipconfig).

## Steps performed

2. Ran basic networking commands:
   - `ipconfig /all`
   - `ping 8.8.8.8`
   - `tracert 8.8.8.8`

## Results   
Add your screenshots here later:
- TryHackMe badge  
- [ipconfig result](screenshots/week1-ipconfig.png) 
- ping test  
- [traceroute result](screenshots/week1-tracert.png)



## Learnings
- Understood how each OSI layer works.  
- Learned to check IP configuration and test connectivity.  
- Understood difference between local and external connectivity.
